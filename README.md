- 👋 Hi, I’m @NolZzyzyxMerakpolgri
- 👀 I’m interested in science fiction, fantasy, "speculative fiction" in general and worldbuilding in particular.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning nothing. Might learn how to do my own project thing on here too. Probably not anything too arcane.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Insculpo's Stellar Abyss project, in fact that's primarily why I set up here, at least originally.
- 📫 How to reach me? mrshllhrrsn@gmail.com, theoretically.
I'm 15 year old pathetic no sense of self entity with a variety of interests including spooky atmospheric vibes, weird aliens, neuroses, people and the cosmos. They/them or he/him. Human. Dumb.
